This project, Dz_Doctors, was a web application I started working on during my master's preparation period. However, after some reflection, I have decided to discontinue development on this project.

### Technologies Used:
- üöÄ **Next.js** ‚Äì For building the React-based frontend.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Strapi** ‚Äì For managing the backend and content **check backend branch**.
- üîë **KindeAuth** ‚Äì For handling authentication.
- üé® **Tailwind CSS** ‚Äì For styling, using utility-first classes to create a clean and responsive design.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Grid Layout** ‚Äì For creating a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

### Features:
The application allowed users to search for doctors and book appointments. Although I initially made progress, I stopped development due to not adhering to clean code principles, which led to a less maintainable codebase. I‚Äôve chosen not to continue this project, but the experience has provided valuable lessons in improving my development practices.

### Video Showcase:
You can view a video about the project [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ramzi-hadrouk-a85973277_this-video-showcases-the-dzdoctors-web-activity-7237922920256188416-uS9z?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

### Conclusion:
This project has been a useful learning experience, but I will not be continuing its development. I am now focusing on improving my coding practices and applying clean code principles in future projects.




-------------------------------
-------------------------------

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
